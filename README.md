# my first websites shrine

my first websites shrine is a tribute to my personal experience of the web between around 2001-2007 before Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Google, Facebook began monopolizing our (my) online attention.

## About

When I arrived to the internet it felt entirely populated by shrines. That perception was colored by the fact that I was an Asian pre-teen anime lover living in the suburbs, desperate for connection. Calling those early websites "shrines" seems like a misnomer, but they were genuinely places of collection and appreciation. People gathered to them.

In Dynamic Web Development we were asked to title a file "first-website". I think my first website was a geocities "shrine" to Squirtle. After that I remember making a website devoted to [pygmy falcons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_falcon) in the computer lab at summer camp for some reason. I had other online spaces that were more personal to me than my hometown. The first time I touched code was to change CSS styling on my Livejournal. I set up an FTP client to send drawings to friends. Then I got older, got new friends, moved away, lost touch.

This exercise was a bit like driving through my childhood neighborhood after 10 years away. Most of my favorite places have been torn down or are unrecognizable. I don't remember many details. It's strange that in the past 5 years everyone seems so overly documented yet these AIM chatrooms and forums where I learned to be a person are lost to time and the Wayback Machine. (I'm happy for the loss.)

## Setup

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->

### Prerequisites

To make a first websites shrine you need the following:

1. A text editor
2. Some favorite places on the internet
3. Artifacts of those places (images, memories)

### Develop

This is my shrine, but I would love it if you used this as a template to make your own shrine to your discreet corners of the internet. To do so, follow the steps below:

1. create a fork of this project on Github
2. open the file in your text editor of choice and make updates
3. if you would like to add images, collect them. They're not necessary though!
4. have a nice chat and communication with me about those changes
5. celebrate the contribution!
