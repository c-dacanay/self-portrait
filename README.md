## Credit

The animation of a girl with headphones is by [Juan Pablo Machado](http://jpmachado.art/) popularized by ChilledCow's [Youtube stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A)</a>.

The music playing underneath her is a clip of Nujabes' song [Reflections Eternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRcBMM-syVc).

The videogame clip of from Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The music underneath is my favorite song from the OST, [Tarrey Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqhZbK6RI8g).

This website is set in Courier. All illustrations were done by me, in Figma. While this does look like my media console, in reality I don't watch much TV.
